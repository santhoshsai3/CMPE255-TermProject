## Understanding Recommender System

Nowadays, all of the well-known firms such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, Spotify, and others have become successful as a result of one method: the recommendation system, which benefits both consumers and businesses.

Online shopping is all over the internet . All our needs are just a click away. The biggest of them all is the website AMAZON. The one thing that Amazon is known for other than the variety of products it sells. It's very powerful and accurate recommendation system. A website such as Amazon is built on the business model of recommending the right products to the right user. Successfully doing this might result in a huge revenue jump for the company. Here we are trying to build a recommendation product system based on the previous purchase patterns and ratings.

It suggests to customers the most often viewed products, as well as related products with high ratings, to assist individuals in online shopping in finding the perfect product.



## Dataset
Dataset:  We are using a dataset from Kaggle from the link below.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skillsmuggler/amazon-ratings?select=ratings_Beauty.csv
The CSV consists of around 12 lakh items and 4 columns. The dataset contains lakhs of rows for user id, the product id and the corresponding ratings that particular user has given to that particular product. 


## Problem being investigated
Recommender systems are an integral part of many online systems. From e-commerce to online streaming platforms. 
Recommender systems employ the past purchase pattern on its user to predict which other products they may be interested in and likely to purchase. Recommending the right products gives a significant advantage to the business. A major portion of the revenue is generated through recommendations. 

We are planning to implement collaborative filtering using memory based technique of distance proximity using cosine distances and nearest neighbors. We can also play with data by using Jackard similarity. The Collaborative Filtering method is extensively used in streaming platforms and e-commerce sites where customers engage with individual products (in our instance, beauty products) and rate them.
