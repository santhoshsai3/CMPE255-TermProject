Title: Product Recommender System Based on the Ratings

Dataset:  We are using a dataset from Kaggle from the link below.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skillsmuggler/amazon-ratings?select=ratings_Beauty.csv
The CSV consists of around 12 lakh items and 4 columns. The dataset contains lakhs of rows for user id, the product id and the corresponding ratings that particular user has given to that particular product. 

Problem Statement: Oniline shopping is all over the internet . All our needs are just a click away. The biggest of them all is the website AMAZON. The one thing Amazon is known for other than the variety of products it seels is its very powerful and accurate recommendation system. A website such as Amazon is built on the business model of recommending the right products to the right user. Successfully doing this might result in a huge revenue jump for the company. Here we are trying to build a recommendation product system based on the previous purchase patterns and ratings.

Planned Solution: Recommender systems are an integral part of many online systems. From e-commerce to online streaming platforms. Recommender systems employ the past purchase pattern on its user to predict which other products they may be interested in and likely to purchase. Recommending the right products gives a significant advantage to the business. A major portion of the revenue is generated through recommendations. We are planning to implement collaborative filtering using memory based technique of distance proximity using cosine distances and nearest neighbors. Additionally we can also around with data using Jackard similarity. Collaborative Filtering algorithm is widely used in streaming platforms and e-commerce sites where the customer interacts with each product(beauty products in our case) and gives ratings.
