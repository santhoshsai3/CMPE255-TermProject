Title: Product Recommender System Based on the Ratings

Dataset:  We are using a dataset from Kaggle from the link below.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skillsmuggler/amazon-ratings?select=ratings_Beauty.csv
The CSV consists of around 12 lakh items and 4 columns.

Problem Statement: A website such as Amazon is built on the business model of recommending the right products to the right user. Successfully doing this might result in a huge revenue jump for the company. Here we are trying to build a recommendation product system based on the previous purchase patterns and ratings.

Planned Solution: The main idea of this project is to  implement collaborative filtering using memory based technique of distance proximity using cosine distances and nearest neighbors. Additionally we can play around with data using Jackard similarity.
